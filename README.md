## A Hand to Hold

# Hold hands, and let your loved ones know you are close #

According to [a 2018 survey from The Economist and the Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.economist.com/international/2018/09/01/loneliness-is-a-serious-public-health-problem), 22% of US adults say they always or often feel lonely, lack companionship, or feel left out or isolated. It is quite easy nowadays for adults to be drawn away from social interaction in favor of digital entertainment or distractions from their smart phone. In addition, [more adults are living by themselves](https://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/all-by-myself), contributing to further potential for isolation from others. 

In response, consumer electronics developers have created friendship lights. Friendship lights are devices which pair together in networks. When one approaches or touches their friendship light, their friend network's friendship lights shine in a unique color, letting their owners know that you are thinking of them. In some cases, one might even light up many different friendship lights in various networks to connect large and complex social groups. 

Most friendship lights on the market are lantern structures that one might place on their desk or bedside table. Unfortunately, they cost well over $100 and are not portable. Smartphone friendship light alternatives -- like a pulsating heartbeat one can send on Apple Watches -- require even more expensive electronics and further encourage smartphone interaction. 

A Hand to Hold is an innovative new approach to friendship lights, combining the portability of a smart watch with the calming aesthetic of a lamp. Using a simple 3D scan of your handprint, A Hand to Hold then creates custom-fitting model to fit right into your palm! 

# Setup #

**1. Hardware Setup**

Each Hand to Hold friendship light package comes with two "stones" and wireless charging platforms. To begin using your friendship lights, first plug in your wireless charging platforms and place each "stone" on top of its platform. A pulsating LED pattern will then appear on the surface of the "stone" letting you know that it is charging. Once all 12 of the LED indicators have lit, your "stone" is ready for use. Simply remove the "stone" from the charging platform and hold it to activate the startup sequence. Your "stone" will then begin pulsating with a blue light, indicating that it is ready to pair with your cell phone.

**2. Software Setup** 

A Hand to Hold requires that you and your loved ones have Android smartphones to communicate with each other's "stones." Each user should download the free Hand to Hold application from the Google Play store. Inside the application, each user may create a unique profile in order to communicate with each other. Once each user has created their profile, you will be directed to create your networks and select your friends. Once successfully selected, you and your friend will be encouraged to select a unique color to represent each other when you hold your "stone."

**3. Enjoy**

Whenever you take hold of your "stone", your network's stones will  glow with custom 12-light RGB animations and colors that you select, letting them know that you are thinking of them.  

The schematics include the wireless charging transceiver and receiver boards. The receiver board includes an ESP32-PICO-D4 microcontroller along with capacitive touch contacts and a circular array of 12 RGB LEDs.
